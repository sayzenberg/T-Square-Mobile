T-Square Mobile
=============
This is a mobile interface for T-Square, Georgia Tech's course management system. It is designed to provide a richer experience for smartphone users by providing a native Android application and a JQuery Mobile web app for non-Android users. This provides a more intuitive interface than T-Square's text-only mobile interface.
